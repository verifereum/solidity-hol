(* The importer's read of the pinned compiler's own Yul, and what it refuses.
 * See syntax/yulImportLib.sml.
 *
 * The fixture is a real artifact of the pinned compiler, of the corpus's
 * smallest suite, so the admitted shape is one solc really emits rather than
 * one written to suit the importer. Its two stages cover both keys the
 * importer reads (irAst and irOptimizedAst).
 *
 * The refusal cases below are built here as JSON values, each differing from
 * an admitted minimal object in exactly one place; the build fails if the
 * importer admits one of them, or refuses it for the wrong reason.
