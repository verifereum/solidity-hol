(* The Yul-side evaluation conversion, run over every function of the corpus's
 * scalars suite.
 *
 * The fixture is the pinned compiler's own Yul for testdata/differential/
 * scalars.sol, committed under testdata/yul/expected so that CI, which has no
 * compiler, can import it -- the arrangement yulImportTest and yulContractTest
 * use for their fixtures, one step further on: the conversion is not checked
 * on a hand-built tree but run over a whole real object.
 *
 * What is checked is that each function of the runtime object reaches a closed
 * form within the size bound.  All but one of the object's functions are
 * loop-free -- checked_exp_helper has a loop, and a loop is a lemma about a
 * loop head rather than a closed form, so its form stops at the loop and one
 * iteration is converted on its own (at the end of this file) -- and the build
 * fails if any of them does not close, or closes with the evaluator's own
 * functions still in it.  A form is a case tree over the body's guards and over
 * the calls it makes, so a function that calls nothing has nothing of its own
 * frame left -- only the memory read itself, whose own clauses want a length
 * that is a successor while the evaluator reads with a numeral, so it does not
 * reduce even where the machine is one the conversion has in hand (the note on
 * `memory_read_residue` below) -- and one that calls is left waiting on the
 * frame a callee returned and nothing else (see semantics/yulConvLib.sml).  The
 * slowest conversion and the total time are printed to say what the suite
 * costs, and every conversion runs under a clock, so one that stops coming back
 * fails the build instead of leaving it at the heap cap.
 *
 * Every loop-free function is held to the size bound.  A function the bound
 * cannot be asked of goes in `excluded` below with the reason it is there, and
 * every name there has to be a function of the object (see the comment on the
 * list, which is empty now).  A line that says a function produces no form is
 * converted under that clock too, and fails the build as soon as it comes
 * back; the clock is what makes such a claim honest rather than taken on
 * trust.
