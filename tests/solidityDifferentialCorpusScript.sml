(* The differential regression corpus, testdata/differential/corpus.json: every
 * case is a kernel-checked differential_agrees theorem relating the deployed
 * bytecode from the pinned compiler to the elaborated source. The build fails
 * if any suite or case does not agree. See docs/differential-testing.md.

(* Read by holbuild's dependency scanner, which stages the corpus; it must list
 * the corpus and every artifact the corpus names, which
