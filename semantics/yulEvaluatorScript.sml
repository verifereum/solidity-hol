(* The Yul evaluator: a fuel-indexed, executable interpreter for the runtime
 * object, written so that it cv_evals.
 *
 * Fuel: n bounds every recursive step that is not structural. Sibling
 * statements and the arguments of one call reuse the bound; entering a
 * function takes two off, the call expression's own test and the invoked
 * body's, and a loop's back edge takes one off, so straight-line code and a
 * loop's first iteration need none. A run that nests deeper or iterates
 * longer than its fuel reaches ends in YulOutOfFuel rather than in a wrong
 * answer.
 *
 * Scopes: a block, an if branch, a switch case, a loop body, a loop's post
 * statement and a call each run in a pushed scope; leaving pops exactly that
 * scope, so writes to enclosing bindings survive and a branch's locals do not.
 * A for loop's prelude runs in the loop's own scope, which is why its variable
 * is visible in the condition, body and post statement.
 *
 * Order: a call's arguments are evaluated right to left, as Yul specifies, and
 * case values are tried in order.
 *
 * Values: expressions produce a list of 256-bit words, since a call to a
 * user-defined function can return several. Binding or returning the wrong
 * number of them is an error rather than a silent truncation, as is a literal
 * too long for the dialect, an unknown function, an unbound name, a builtin
 * called with the wrong number of arguments, an immutable the frame does not
 * carry, and the object-level builtins, which a runtime object never contains.
 *
 * Memory, storage, calls and logs: the builtins that read or write them are in
 * eval_yul_builtin below, on the machine in yulState. Memory is byte-addressed
 * and every access raises its active size. Nothing here reads gas.
