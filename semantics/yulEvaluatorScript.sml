(* The Yul evaluator: a fuel-indexed, executable interpreter for creation and
 * runtime objects, written so that it cv_evals.
 *
 * Fuel: n bounds every recursive step that is not structural. Sibling
 * statements and the arguments of one call reuse the bound; entering a
 * function takes two off, the call expression's own test and the invoked
 * body's, and a loop's back edge takes one off, so straight-line code and a
 * loop's first iteration need none. A run that nests deeper or iterates
 * longer than its fuel reaches ends in YulOutOfFuel rather than in a wrong
 * answer.
 *
 * Scopes: a block, an if branch, a switch case, a loop body, a loop's post
 * statement and a call each run in a pushed scope; leaving pops exactly that
 * scope, so writes to enclosing bindings survive and a branch's locals do not.
 * A for loop's prelude runs in the loop's own scope, which is why its variable
 * is visible in the condition, body and post statement.
 *
 * Order: a call's arguments are evaluated right to left, as Yul specifies, and
 * case values are tried in order.
 *
 * Values: expressions produce a list of 256-bit words, since a call to a
 * user-defined function can return several. Binding or returning the wrong
 * number of them is an error rather than a silent truncation, as is an
 * argument that is not exactly one value, a literal too long for the dialect,
 * an unknown function, an unbound name, a builtin called with the wrong number
 * of arguments, an immutable the frame does not carry, or an unknown object
 * name. Object builtins read the frame's code, extents and immutable offsets;
 * linker symbols remain unsupported.
 * So is a break or continue that leaves a loop's post statement: Yul allows
 * them only in a loop's body, and one from the post would otherwise reach an
 * enclosing loop.
 *
 * Memory, storage, calls and logs: the builtins that read or write them are in
 * eval_yul_builtin below, on the machine in yulState. Memory is byte-addressed
 * and every access raises its active size.
 *
 * A message call is Verifereum's, not a second call mechanics: call and
 * staticcall both hand the call to run_external_call, the same one-frame
 * construction the source evaluator's high-level calls use, which runs
 * Verifereum's run_call. The callee is always bytecode -- a Yul frame never
 * nests inside another Yul frame -- so a call back into the frame's own
 * address runs that account's deployed code. The callee's return data lands in
 * the frame's return_data buffer, whatever the caller asked for as an output
 * region, and the output region gets the first min(outsize, returndatasize)
 * bytes of it, the same bytes Verifereum's own sub-frame return writes. A call
 * that leaves the model ends in YulInvalid rather than in a guess.
 *
 * Gas is not charged, so gas() reports the whole budget the frame was given
 * and never falls, and a call hands its own gas argument on to the callee,
 * capped at that budget: solc writes gas() there unless the source names a
 * limit. delegatecall goes to run_delegate_call, which runs the callee's code
 * in this frame's account, with the frame's caller and call value.
 * docs/yul-call-design.md says what the model does not do.

 * written out at the call, because a mutual recursion translated through a

 *
 * The frame is the callee's *whole* scope stack, not the caller's with one more

 * The caller is this frame, the callee the builtin's address argument
 * truncated to 160 bits, the value moved before the callee runs, and the
 * callee's own budget the builtin's gas argument capped at this frame's: gas
 * is not charged here, so the frame's budget is the most it can hand on.

 * account runs its delegate's, as the EVM's CALL does. The callee starts
 * from the frame's transient storage, as it does from the frame's accounts.

 * code runs under this frame's address, with its caller and call value, and

 * callee's output either way -- the revert data for a revert, nothing for an
