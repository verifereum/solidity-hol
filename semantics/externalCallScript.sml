(* An external call run on Verifereum: one message call from a caller account
 * to a callee, on a fresh one-frame execution state, returning the callee's
 * outcome and the world it leaves. The caller's own execution is the
 * source's (or the Yul frame's): only the callee runs as EVM code, so a call
 * back into the caller runs the caller's bytecode.
 *
 * As the CALL and STATICCALL opcodes do, value moves before the callee runs,
 * a value the caller cannot pay fails the call without running it, and a
 * failed call (revert, exceptional halt or that) leaves the accounts and
 * transient storage as they were, with no logs. Gas is a fixed budget given
 * by the caller: the source does not track gas, so a callee that runs out of
 * it fails here where the bytecode might not.
 *
 * The callee's frame is fresh rather than nested in the caller's: its
 * original accounts are the world after the value transfer, its access set
 * holds only the caller and callee, and its depth is one. A call that leaves
 * accounts pending deletion is outside the model (NONE), since a fresh frame
 * cannot hand them back to the caller's transaction.
 *
 * The construction follows vyper-hol's concrete external calls.
