(* Unfolding one Yul call: the evaluator's own equations run over the body of
 * one function, with the calls it makes left standing.
 *
 * The Yul side of the translation-validation work has to be compared against
 * the bytecode's function, and the comparison needs the function's body
 * evaluated to a term over its arguments and its entry machine: not the
 * function table, which is the same table for every function, and not the
 * callees, which are proved separately.  The simplifier is the wrong tool for
 * it: the evaluator's equations are stated with `let`, and a simplifier that
 * expands a `let` before its bound term is a value copies the rest of the
 * evaluation into every branch.
 *
 * So the equations are run as compute rules, whose call-by-value order makes
 * a `let`'s bound term a value before it is substituted, and the three things
 * the compute rules cannot do themselves are done here:
 *
 *  - The scopes.  A scope is a chain of updates over the empty map, keyed by
 *    the names the compiler emitted, so `FLOOKUP` on one is decided by
 *    walking the chain: each update's key is a closed string, so the test
 *    `FLOOKUP_UPDATE` leaves is one the test set answers.  Nothing else has to
 *    know the names are literals.
 *
 *  - The call itself.  `invoke_yul`'s equation is deliberately not a compute
 *    rule, so a call the body makes stops there and is handed back to the
 *    caller as an `invoke_yul` application.  The one call that is unfolded is
 *    the one asked for, and its function is read out of the table by the same
 *    walk of the chain.
 *
 *  - The block, whose clause binds a statement's result and tests it.  A call
 *    leaves that result stuck, and evaluating the clause as it stands copies
 *    the rest of the body into every use of the bound name; the block is
 *    split on the statement's outcome instead.  That is the case tree the
 *    translation validation compares against, and it is the difference
 *    between a form of a few hundred constants and one of a few million.  See
 *    the section below.
 *
 * Reading the table is the only part that touches the compiler's whole
 * object, so it happens once per distinct table term and the table is left
 * alone in the form the caller gets: the body's calls name the table the
 * caller passed, not a copy of it.

   The set a test is reduced on.

   `EVAL` is not usable for this.  `wordsLib` adds the word library's rules to
   the *global* set when it is loaded (`computeLib.upd_compset
   (add_words_compset false)`), so `word_exp w v = word_exp_tailrec w v 1w` is
   there whatever set the caller built, and the tail recursion takes the
   exponent apart a bit at a time with no bottom on a symbolic one.  A test that
   holds a `word_exp` must therefore not be reduced on that set -- and it is not
   only a test that holds one: a test whose reduction *reaches* one does too.
   `FLOOKUP scope x = NONE`, the guard the evaluator's own lookup writes, is a
   lookup of a scope whose values hold what the body's calls returned, and the
   conditional `FLOOKUP_UPDATE` makes of it has those values in its branches,
   which a call-by-value reduction takes as well as the guard.  That is how
   `power := cleanup_uint8(exp(base, exponent))` -- one statement of one corpus
   function, its exponent symbolic -- stopped the conversion: nothing in the
   test named `word_exp`, so the scan that keeps `EVAL` off one did not fire,
   and the branches' `word_exp` unfolded the tail recursion on a symbolic
   exponent, which has no bottom.

   So the rules here reduce a test on a set of their own: the global one as it
   was when this file loaded, with the evaluator's own clause for `invoke_yul`
   and for the block taken out (a test's reduction must not unfold a callee
   either, and a scope's values are folded calls), and with the word library's
   exponentiation recursion taken out and the literal-only rule put back.

 *
 * The scope readers are not in this list.  A reader's own case is `option` over

 * `SUC_TO_NUMERAL_DEFN_CONV`), and the scrub above is what takes it out of the

 * so `yul_memory_read … 32` becomes 32 reads -- all of them `0w` over a memory
 * the conversion has, and 32 stuck lookups over one it does not -- which is a

   Splitting a body on its statements' outcomes.

   A block hands each statement's result to the rest of the body as

     let r = eval_yul_stmt n fns s m in
       if r.completion = YulNormal then eval_yul_block n fns ss r.machine else r

   and a statement that makes a call leaves `r` stuck on a call the conversion
   keeps folded.  A conversion that just evaluates that `let` copies the rest
   of the body into every place `r` is used -- three of them -- and then
   evaluates each copy, so a body of k statements comes out at about 3^k times
   the size, and the copies carry the calls' own scaffolding with them: one
   real function of the corpus (five statements, four of them calls) reaches
   four million constants, and one of the ABI decoders on symbolic arguments
   needs 18GB of heap.

   So the statement's result is split out first:

     case eval_yul_stmt n fns s m of
       EvalAbrupt c m' => <the body's continuation on that completion>
     | EvalValues vs m' => <...>

   which is the case tree the Yul side of the translation validation is
   compared against.  A leaf is the body's remainder with the statement's
   outcome substituted -- `r.machine` becomes the branch's own machine, a
   variable -- so the copies are small, and the branching is a call's two
   outcomes rather than the three places `r` was used.

   The split has to happen before the `let` is taken, so it is a compute rule
   for `eval_yul_block` itself rather than a conversion run over the finished
   term: `eval_yul_block`'s own clauses are left out of the compute set and
   this conversion puts the statement's result in the case form the rest of
   the rule set can work with.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------*)

(* The evaluator's result type is the one a block's statements hand each other.
 * Its scrutinee comes first and a constructor's branch function is curried on
 * the constructor's arguments, so splitting means abstracting each branch onto
 * the continuation.  The branch's type is a parameter of its own: a statement
 * hands the block a `yul_result`, and an expression hands a statement a
 * `yul_expr_result`, so the case being split need not be the one `f` is on.
 *
 * The lemmas are `TypeBase.case_rand_of`'s: the kernel states the distribution
 * for every datatype, on the case its `case_def` gives, which is the one the
 * evaluator's own clauses leave behind.  A structure compiled as a library has
 * no theory open to prove a lemma into, and nothing here needs one. *)

(* A case on the evaluator's expression result.  After the compute set has run
 * over a statement this is what being stuck looks like -- for a call, or for a
 * name that reads a machine a call returned -- and it is what the split needs
 * to see. *)

(*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Recognising a call's case the frame rule has already settled.

   The frame rule below rewrites a case on a folded call, `case (invoke_yul …)
   of … | EvalValues vals m' => CONT`, to the same case with the branch's own
   two variables read through what the call answered: `vals` through
   `yul_take_shape fd.function_results vals`, and `m'` through the caller's own
   scope stack, `m' with scopes := m.scopes`.

   Both halves of what the rule wrote are gone from the term by the time a
   later pass sees it: the conversion's own set unfolds the shaping
   (`yul_take_shape_def` is in it, deliberately: the spine is what the clause's
   arity test and the block's binding read), and the scope stack is the record
   package's own update, which the set reduces through.  A marker that looks
   for the rule's own output therefore finds nothing after the round that took
   the shaping out, and the rule fires again on every later pass over the same
   case: a sweep counts 1 283 applications for `fun_bitwise`, whose body has
   five calls, and 24 303 for `checked_exp_signed`.

   What a later application writes is the term that was already there -- the
   branch's values have been read by then, and the machine is up to
   `(m with scopes := s) with scopes := s` -- so what the re-fires cost is the
   rule's instantiation and the re-reduction of the clause, not a larger form.
   The forms of all 137 conversions are what they were before this marker, and
   the 133 the suite covers convert faster: 31.9s against 64.9s at the old one
   (one run each, the same set, the same box), `checked_exp_unsigned` alone at
   1.0s against 3.8.

   So the marker is not what the rule wrote but where it wrote it, and it is a
   question about the branch's own variables rather than about the rule's
   terms.  A case is settled when neither variable the rule rebinds appears
   anywhere the rule's output would not have put it: the values variable
   outside the argument `HD`, `TL` and `yul_take_shape` are handed, and the
   machine variable outside the record the frame's own update writes.  Before

   uses the machine it was handed as a whole -- `yul_normal m'`,
   `yul_bind names vs m'`, `eval_yul_block n fns ss m'` -- so an occurrence
   outside those is what an unsettled case has and a settled one has not.

   The search is over the branch alone.  A case nested in the continuation --
   settled earlier in the same bottom-up pass -- carries a marker of its own,

   Settling a folded call's frame.

   A statement whose expression is a call is a case on `invoke_yul`, whose
   values branch is the rest of the body.  The call is folded, so the body's
   first use of its answer -- `yul_bind names vals m'`, `yul_assign`, a test on
   `m'` -- reads two things the conversion cannot resolve: the length of `vals`
   (against the names it is bound to) and the scope stack of `m'`.  Both are
   decided by the call itself, and neither needs the callee's body:

     - `vals` is as long as the callee declares results, so the spine the
       callee's own result names give is the spine `vals` has, and `ZIP` and
       `list_CASE` -- which match on `::` and `[]`, not on a length -- fire on
       it;
     - `m'` has the caller's own scope stack, because the frame is the callee's
       alone and `invoke_yul` hands the caller its scopes back.

   `yulEvaluatorProps.yul_expr_result_CASE_invoke_frame` states both on the
   case, so a single rewrite settles the branch; what is left in it is the
   caller's own machinery, which the conversion then resolves as it would for
   any other statement.  The callee's declaration comes from the table, read
   the way the entry call's is (`binding_thm`), and the arity the clause itself
   tests is decided on the term.

   Without this, every statement after a call carries a decision per read of
   the call's answer, so a body of k call statements comes out at about 2^k
   times the size -- which is where the corpus's remaining forms are.

   Keeping the client's table out of the set the conversion runs on.

   HOL's compute set imports a theory's definitions as they are made
   (`computeLib.auto_import_definitions`), so a definition a client made before
   this library was loaded is already in `the_compset ()`, and `eval_compset` --
   built on a copy of it -- holds its equation.  A body that calls keeps the
   table as the folded call's own argument, so a set that unfolds it
   substitutes the compiler's whole object into the form -- `CBV_CONV` on the
   global set folds the corpus table to 414 885 nodes, against a statement's own
   evaluation in the tens -- and the machine every later statement is handed
   holds that copy, so the form is proportional to the object rather than to the
   body.

   A client whose fixture is defined *after* this library's load has none of it
   in the set to begin with, so the scrub below is a no-op there: on the corpus
   test, `CBV_CONV eval_compset` leaves both `scalars_function_table` and
   `yul_env scalars_object` standing, neither constant having an equation in the
   set, while the global set folds the table to 414 885 nodes.  What the scrub
   covers is the other order -- a fixture defined before this library loaded --
   and the literal table term a caller may pass instead of a name, whose
   constants do have equations in the set (`yul_env`'s, from `yulAST`).

   Nothing here wants the table unfolded.  The function the conversion was
   asked for is read off the folded chain at the kernel level (`binding_thm`),
   and a call the body makes is left as an `invoke_yul` application, so the
   table is only ever the constant the caller gave.  The client's own
   definitions are therefore scrubbed from the set, which leaves that constant
   alone -- in the form and in the set's own view of it.
