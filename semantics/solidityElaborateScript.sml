(* Elaboration of the normalised source AST (solidityImport) to the ordered
 * core, for the pinned profile solc-0.8.37-via-ir-osaka.
 * docs/frontend-boundary.md lists the admitted subset.
 *
 * Elaboration also checks each function body against the compiler's
 * annotations, at the node whose type it computes: every type annotation
 * agrees with the elaborated type (source_type_matches), operators and
 * literal kinds are in the admitted sets, calls and emits have matching
 * arity, declarations, returns, break, continue and placeholders occur
 * where the source allows them, and a pure function reads no state
 * variable. A function that fails returns its blockers, which preparation
 * (solidityPrepareLib) turns into marking that function unsupported.
 *
 * One contract is elaborated, flattened along its bases. An internal call
 * runs the most derived override of the function it names (call_table), and
 * a super call the function super_table finds along the bases after the
 * caller's; the functions no other overrides are elaborated, and the external
 * and public ones among them, receive and fallback form the dispatch table.
 * Each constant is two procedures that return its value converted to its
 * type, one with checked and one with wrapping arithmetic, and a reference
 * to it calls the one of its own arithmetic, as the compiler's IR calls a
 * function per constant. State-variable initializers, constructors and
 * base-constructor arguments form one creation procedure.
 *
 * Schedules, read from the compiler's IR for this profile (the ir output in
 * testdata/frontend/expected/pure_core.json) and checked against the compiled
 * bytecode by the differential tests:
 *  - binary operands, call, emit and error arguments and tuple components are
 *    evaluated left to right, each read of a local or a state variable being a copy taken
 *    when it is evaluated;
 *  - && and || evaluate their right operand only when needed;
 *  - x op= e evaluates e, then reads x, then writes x;
 *  - ++ and -- read, step (checked unless unchecked) and write back, yielding
 *    the new (prefix) or old (postfix) value;
 *  - a tuple assignment evaluates its right-hand side into fresh values,
 *    captures its targets left to right, then writes them right to left;
 *  - return values and declared variables are converted as the source types
 *    require;
 *  - creation evaluates the base-constructor arguments of each contract, most
 *    derived first, then, base first, runs each contract's state-variable
 *    initializers in declaration order and then its constructor body.
 *
 * Loops: a while condition is elaborated into the loop prelude, which reruns
 * on every iteration. for (init; c; next) body runs init once, then a loop
 * whose prelude runs next on every iteration but the first, then c; so
 * continue reaches next before the condition. do body while (c) is a loop
 * whose prelude evaluates c on every iteration but the first; so continue
 * reaches the condition. A first-iteration flag implements both.
 *
 * Elaboration uses fresh ids above every node id of the unit for temporaries
 * and capture targets. Its output is checked by wf_core_program; it is not
 * proved to be well formed in general.
