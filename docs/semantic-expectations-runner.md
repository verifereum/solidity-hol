# Running upstream call expectations

The acceptance report in [semantic-tests-coverage.md](semantic-tests-coverage.md)
checks whether the core admits a source program. The expectation runner separately
executes those admitted programs against the upstream test's return values,
revert data and events. It runs on demand; the upstream corpus sweep is absent
from per-PR CI.

The committed [summary](semantic-expectations.md) lists every selected test and
each inconclusive call. The [JSON report](semantic-expectations.json) retains
the inputs and execution observations for every call.

## Running

Use the pinned Solidity checkout described in the acceptance report, and the
same compiler executable:

```sh
python3 tools/run_semantic_expectations.py ../solidity-tests \
  --solc /path/to/solc-0.8.37 \
  --work-dir /path/to/sweep-work -j4
```

The work directory retains compiler artifacts, the ordered-call manifest and
batch logs. The runner writes `docs/semantic-expectations.json` and `.md`. Use
`--match substring` and `--output /path/to/report` for a focused run. A focused
report covers only its selected tests, rather than the whole acceptance set.
After an interrupted run, repeat the command with `--resume`. Completed tests
are reused only when the manifest and runner/evaluator source fingerprint match;
an incomplete test restarts from deployment. Changed inputs require a new work
directory. The JSON report records the source fingerprint.

The runner selects tests marked admitted by the committed coverage JSON. It
reuses `semantic_tests_coverage.read_test` and `compile_test`, then rechecks
`solidityPrepareLib.prepare_artifact` before execution. Preparation changes are
reported as not runnable; this runner does not recompute or replace the blocker
scan. The compiler identity, corpus revision and profile must match the pin.

## Execution and comparison

The main source is the test's last `Source` section, and the target is its last
contract declaration, following isoltest. An omitted constructor expectation
causes an implicit zero-value deployment. The constructor runs through
`deploy_contract`; subsequent calls run through `call_contract`, sharing the
committed world and constructor-produced immutables. Calldata is the signature's
compiler-recorded selector followed by the expectation's raw bytes. `()` passes
raw calldata without a selector.

The expectation format describes bytes, not typed argument values: numeric and
boolean tokens occupy one word, quoted strings pad on the right, `hex"..."`
contributes unpadded bytes, and `left(...)`/`right(...)` specify alignment.
The tokenizer and structural parser follow the pinned isoltest grammar for
signatures, comma-separated parameters, paired comments and string escapes.
Comments may span lines; call signatures ignore spaces and tabs. Calls may omit
arrows and may follow another call on the same physical line.
`FAILURE` expects a revert with the following exact bytes. Constructor
expectations compare success/failure only, as isoltest discards creation output.

A revert restores the pre-transaction world, including the value transfer.
Successful calls commit storage and balances. Logs and transient storage reset
between transactions. Account-selection and balance/storage builtins do not
advance blocks. The transaction environment follows the pinned isoltest host,
including its funded accounts, origin, block progression and first deployment
address. Precompile addresses 1–8 start with one wei each, as in isoltest.
This differs from the maintained differential corpus's deliberately
distinct environment fields.

Calls agree only when their return/revert bytes and event logs match. Core
invalid completions and fuel exhaustion are not runnable. The entire expectation
block is parsed before replay. Unknown tokens, unsupported byte encodings and
unsupported observations reject that block before any transaction executes.
The supported subset excludes leading-zero numerals, fixed-point parameters, aligned strings or signed
literals, strings longer than one word, library directives and non-event side
effects. Recognized unsupported builtins retain their call rows with a reason;
an unparseable block has a single diagnostic row because its call boundaries
are unknown. Aligned parameters can continue after a colon, comma or arrow.
Builtins observe the preceding transaction's logs, including when they expect
no events. Explicit event expectations after builtin directives are not runnable.
Calls explicitly marked as out-of-gas are not runnable: the core does not charge
gas, so success cannot be checked against that failure expectation. Gas
observations are explicitly recorded as not runnable and counted separately
from calls, since gas is outside the core model. No gas agreement is implied.

Test results prioritize a disagreement over a not-runnable call; a fully
agreeing test has all of its calls agreeing. The JSON retains every call's
input, expectation, actual result and reason. Agreement checks the observations
the upstream test asks for, rather than all final storage; this differs from
[differential execution](differential-testing.md), which compares complete
storage against compiler bytecode as well.

For mismatch triage, add `--verify-bytecode` to run the same ordered transactions
in Verifereum from the pinned compiler's creation and runtime bytecode. The JSON
then retains the bytecode outcome beside the core outcome.
Creation and runtime execution use isoltest's 100,000,000 gas budget, with no
outer transaction fees. Creation gas exhaustion is recorded as unavailable
bytecode evidence, rather than an ordinary revert.
