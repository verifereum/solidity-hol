(* Normalized source AST: the admitted subset of the pinned compiler's
 * analyzed Standard JSON AST, between the raw compiler output and the core.
 *
 * solidityImportLib builds these terms from a compiler artifact and fails
 * closed: an unknown nodeType, a missing required field, or a feature outside
 * the subset (overriding state variables, file-level constants,
 * super other than in calls, named or try calls, built-ins other than
 * require, assert, revert, members of msg, tx and block, this and
 * type(T).max and .min for integer types T, literal subdenominations,
 * inline arrays, type names other than elementary, contract and struct types,
 * arrays and mappings, ...)
 * raises ImportError. Semantic nodes keep their compiler id and source range;
 * declarations are referred to by id, and names are diagnostic only. Type
 * annotations are kept as the compiler's encoded typeIdentifier and decoded
 * here, never from the display typeString.
 *
 * A unit holds its deployable contracts: those neither abstract, nor an
 * interface, nor a base of another contract of the unit. Each is flattened
 * along its linearization (src_contract); its bases, the functions it calls
 * and the structs it uses may come from any source unit of the compilation
 * (unit_sources), since the AST refers to declarations by id across files.
 * The internal functions, modifiers and constants of libraries it uses come
 * with it: L.f(args) and x.f(args), with f attached to x's type by a using
 * directive, are internal calls of f, the latter with x as the first
 * argument, and L.c names the constant c.
 *
 * A contract or interface type is read as address, its value at run time,
 * stored and ABI encoded as one: in type names, type identifiers and storage
 * layouts, and as the target of a conversion I(a). this is the contract's
 * own address.
 *
 * Types are normalized from elementary, array and mapping type-name nodes; value
 * types are decoded from typeIdentifiers. Both yield only valid shapes (normalize_type_name_valid,
 * decode_type_identifier_valid). Literals keep their exact rational type.
 *
 * valid_src_unit then establishes, for an imported unit:
 *  - each contract's node ids, with the unit's, are distinct (contracts
 *    share the declarations of a common base or library), and the unit is
 *    among its compilation's source units;
 *  - every parameter, return, local and state variable has a normalized
 *    elementary, array or mapping type, the default data location, and a
 *    type identifier agreeing with that type, and the enclosing function,
 *    block, for statement or one of the contract's bases as its scope; event
 *    parameters are elementary, scoped by their event;
 *  - the contract's bases are distinct and start with the contract itself;
 *  - the contract's storage layout lists its state variables in
 *    linearization order, bases first, each with its own typeIdentifier and
 *    a slot below 2 ** 256;
 *  - every identifier resolves, within its lexical scope, to a variable of the
 *    annotated type, or, as the callee of a call, to a function of the same
 *    contract, the most derived override of the one it names (call_table),
 *    or to an internal library function;
 *    calls have matching arity and are annotated with the callee's
 *    return types; conversions are annotated with their normalized target type;
 *    environment reads with their member's type; type(T).max and .min an
 *    integer type T, with T's type; emits name an event of the
 *    contract with as many arguments as it has parameters, and reverts with
 *    an error carry as many arguments as the error has parameters, which
 *    are of elementary types;
 *  - declaration statements list exactly their declarations' ids as
 *    assignments, returns name the enclosing function's return list, break and
 *    continue occur in loop bodies, conditions are boolean;
 *  - functions, receive and fallback are pure, view, nonpayable or payable,
 *    and only non-pure ones refer to state variables; functions a more
 *    derived one overrides are checked only when a super call reaches
 *    them, since nothing else does; a super call runs the first function
 *    with the name and parameter types of the one it names in a base after
 *    the caller's, and modifier bodies make none;
 *    contracts are scoped by the unit, functions by a base of their contract,
 *    structs by a base or a source unit of the compilation;
 *  - library functions are internal or private, scoped by a library distinct
 *    from the bases, and see no state variable;
 *  - constants are of elementary value types or byte sequences, declared by
 *    a base or a library, and their values refer to other constants only; an
 *    identifier may name a constant;
 *  - operators belong to the admitted set and every other expression
 *    annotation decodes to an elementary, rational literal or tuple type;
 *    an operation over literals the compiler types as an integer is that
 *    integer.
 *
 * Left to elaboration: implicit conversions (operand and argument types
 * against commonType and parameter types, literal ranges), return value
 * arity and types, assignment target shapes and their types, and evaluation
 * order, which the AST does not record. Left to the compiler: storage layout
 * calculation, that view functions write no state variable, and the
 * override metadata: which declarations each function overrides, and that
 * functions come most derived first.
