(* Yul, as the pinned compiler's via-IR output emits it.
 *
 * The tree is deep: statements, expressions and literals are separate
 * datatypes, and a call to a dialect builtin carries the builtin rather than
 * its name, so the dialect's builtin set is fixed here once and the evaluator
 * never has to look a name up to know what an operation is. Calls to
 * user-defined functions keep their name; resolving a name to a function is
 * the environment's job (yul_env, below), not the tree's.
 *
 * Names are strings throughout, as in the Yul text: the compiler emits unique
 * names, so a string-keyed environment is exact for this profile, and a name
 * the environment does not bind is an error rather than a guess.
 *
 * Scope is not recorded in the tree. A block, an if branch, a loop body and a
 * call each introduce a scope, and the evaluator pushes one wherever the
 * grammar says so; a body below is therefore a statement list, not a nested
 * block node.
 *
 * The builtins are those the pinned solc emits over the fixtures in
 * testdata/ in either of its Yul stages (see testdata/yul/reconnaissance.json;
 * the unittest tests/test_yul_reconnaissance.py checks the dialect's names
 * against it), plus the ones contracts beyond the corpus need: the executing
 * account, a three-topic log, a memory-to-memory copy and an immutable value
 * the constructor patched in.  The three object-level ones (codecopy,
 * datasize, dataoffset) occur only in the creation object, whose semantics is
 * a later step; they are here so the set is complete and the evaluator can
 * reject them rather than misread them.
